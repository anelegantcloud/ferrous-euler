This repository holds [one coder][anelegantcloud]'s solutions to [Project Euler][project-euler].

Try for yourself: `cargo test`

## Objectives

Development of this repository serves three objectives.

1. Practice **problem solving** and **mathematics** skills.
2. Gain insight into emerging development **workflows** and **tools**.
3. Experiment with **energy efficient** software development methods.

## Methods

Development of this repository follows these methods.

- **Daily commits.** Each day's progress is committed and pushed.
- **Test first.** Problems are communicated as tests prior to implementation.
- **Prioritize learning.** Solutions are public. We build to share our learnings.

## Tools

Development of this repository uses these tools.

- [Rust Lang][rust-lang] is used to code solutions to Project Euler problems.
Rust provides high performance efficiency to minimize power consumption and carbon footprint.
- [AWS Cloud9][aws-cloud9] is used for development environments. 
AWS Cloud9 provides an in-browser IDE, automatic shutdown, and the ability to measure carbon footprint.
- [Firefox Browser][firefox] is used to access Project Euler and development environments. 
Firefox provides a mainstream alternative to Chromium based browsers.
